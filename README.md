# Slither.io Bot Gen3
I'm tinkering with this bot & learning a lot about math and algorithms.  Its still in development but I am attempting to:
1. Improve on the food gathering (travelling salesman problem!)
2. Optimize enemy detection (lots of complicated trig!)
3. Asist mode, help little kids play. (like Tesla Autopilot!)

## Installation
Note this is still in alpha!

1. If you are on Chrome, download the [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) extension. Otherwise use the [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) extension.
2. Once installed, click on [this link](https://github.com/xanderak/slither.io-bot/raw/master/bot.user.js), and choose **Install**.
