# Slither.io Bot Gen3
I'm tinkering with this bot & learning a lot about math and algorithms.  Its still in development but I am attempting to:
1. Improve on the food gathering (travelling salesman problem!)
2. Optimize enemy detection (lots of complicated trig!)
3. Asist mode, help little kids play. (like Tesla Autopilot!)
